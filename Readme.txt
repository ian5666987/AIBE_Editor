AIBE Editor a solution created by me to help to write AIBE scripts with minimal effort.

*) It provides full description of the scripts (what the scripts do exactly).
*) It provides word suggestions as you type, just like IntelliSense for Visual Studio or any other editor with similar functionality.
*) It colors the typed words according to its role/type in its context, greatly help the scripting processing.
*) It helps to compile the scripts for the entire database used and shows errors if there is any.
*) Flexible to use, can be used to change the entire scripts or only the selected parts.
*) More help available in the application itself
*) See my AIBE project repository (https://github.com/ian5666987/AIBE) for more information.
